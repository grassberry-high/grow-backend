# How to report a bug
### Security disclosures
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email hello@grassberry-high.com instead.

### File a bug report

1. What version of Node.js/GrassberryHigh are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

### Suggesting a feature

Please write explicit which functionality is missing. Include examples: input > output.

# Code review process
### How a contribution gets accepted after itâ€™s been submitted.

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

### Coding style

As mentioned above please make sure that your code lints. Please, format your code! 

### Explain if you use any commit message conventions.

We use the following style:

\<commit type\>: \<commit message\>
commit types are:
- min: minor change, e.g. removed a space
- update: new feature, e.g. update Water sensor hdc1000 has a safety fuse
- refactor: refactor, e.g. use forEach instead of Array.from
- fix: bug fixes, e.g. relay controller does not fail after switching relay
- other: (anything else)
